## Other Informations About The Project

I built this project because I'm really interested in the financial world, stock market and the combination of technology and finance (FinTech). <br>
This is mainly a front-end project and it's still in alpha phase and for demonstration purpose only. I will add new features and complete login and user authentication in the future. The purpose of this project was to focus on the front-end (Interactive chart, score graph, dashboard layout, mobile responsive, custom css, intuitive UI). <br>
